# pyrepl

##Origins
pyrepl is a reimplementation in python of [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise).

A special thanks here to antirez and all linenoise project contributors. 

Maybe it should have been named after linenoise but it would have been presomptuous given that 
this code has been translated into python in less than few hours and not really tested.

Maybe it should have been shorter too ... Python is more expressive than C and close to it too. 

So, apologises for that and feel free to do whatever you want with it and let me know at plu9in at google mail.

##About pyrepl
As its parents, pyrepl is a line editing "library". It works like linenoise (almost).

Just have a look at the example to see how to use it. With it, coding a read-eval-print-loop is really
easy and it was missing in Python. Solutions found were not as complete as linenoise.
